## Operators in Python
# Operators are special symbols in Python that perform operations on variables and values. Python supports a variety of operators, including Arithmetic, Comparison, and Logical operators.#
# This is the addition operator
# x = 5
# y = 3
# print(x + y)  # Outputs: 8

# This is the multiplication operator
# x = 10
# y = 100
# print(x * y)  # Outputs: 1000

# This is the subtraction operator

# b = 10000
# r = 700
# # print(b - r) # Outputs: 9300
# print (b / r)

## The Modulus Operator
# h = 2
# t = 5

# print (h % t)

# Comparison Operators:
# Comparison operators compare two values and return a Boolean (True or False).

# x = 5
# y = 3
# # print(x == y)  # Outputs: False

#     #• Not Equal (!=):
# print(x != y)  # Outputs: True

   # • Greater Than (>):
# print(x > y)  # Outputs: True

# Less than (<):
# print(x < y)  # Outputs: False

   # • Greater Than or Equal To (>=):
# print(x >= y)  # Outputs: True
#     • Less Than or Equal To (<=):
# print(x <= y)  # Outputs: False

# LOOPS
#For Loop

# numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# for num in numbers:
#     print(num)

# While Loop

# num = 1
# while num <= 10:
#   break
# cprint (num + 3)
# num =1
# while num <=100:
#     print(num)
#     num +=1

## Functions

## Function naming/Definition

# This code defines a function called my_function that prints a greeting message to the user. 
# The function does not take any parameters and does not return any value. 
# It prints three lines of text: "Hello Loveth the trouble maker", "I hope this class penetrates your mind", and "Thank You!".
# def my_function():
